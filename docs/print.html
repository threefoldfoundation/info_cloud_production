<h1 id="threefold-cloud"><a class="header" href="#threefold-cloud"> ThreeFold Cloud.</a></h1>
<p>The digital landscape is ready for a transformative cloud solution. Presently, dominant cloud platforms like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft are centralized. Yet, a significant portion of the global population remains underserved, lacking robust internet access and proximate data and computing resources.</p>
<p>Enter ThreeFold. Over the past five years, we've been pioneering technology that facilitates the global distribution of compute, storage, and network capacity. While our current reach might not rival giants like Google, the potential of our approach is groundbreaking. The ThreeFold Grid, our foundational infrastructure, operates on principles distinct from conventional cloud giants.</p>
<p>The uniqueness of the ThreeFold Grid lies in its decentralized ownership. Numerous individuals and companies worldwide contribute hardware to the collective, enhancing global access to storage, compute, and network resources. These contributors, known as ThreeFold farmers, receive ThreeFold Tokens as rewards for both providing this capacity and also earn additional rewards when the capacity is utilized.</p>
<p>Based in Dubai, ThreeFold Cloud is now delivering services on top of this grid. Yet, it ensures that every user retains complete control and access to their deployed workloads.</p>
<h3 id="threefold-dmcc-the-driving-force-behind-threefold-cloud"><a class="header" href="#threefold-dmcc-the-driving-force-behind-threefold-cloud">ThreeFold DMCC: The Driving Force Behind ThreeFold Cloud</a></h3>
<p>ThreeFold Cloud operates under the umbrella of ThreeFold DMCC, a company based in one of the best regulated economic free zones in Dubai. This strategic positioning allows us to tap into the dynamic and innovative environment of the region, fostering growth and expansion of the ThreeFold grid.</p>
<p>ThreeFold DMCC is not just our corporate identity; it's the hub from which we manage and operate essential community tools. This includes platforms like our dedicated forum, where users, developers, and enthusiasts can engage in meaningful discussions, share insights, and collaborate on projects. Additionally, our websites, which serve as the primary interface for our audience to learn about and interact with our offerings, are also managed from this central point.</p>
<p>ThreeFold DMCC is the organizational backbone, ensuring smooth operations, community engagement, and the continuous scaling of the ThreeFold grid.</p>
<h3 id="threefold-clouds-expansion-and-fundraising-initiative"><a class="header" href="#threefold-clouds-expansion-and-fundraising-initiative">ThreeFold Cloud's Expansion and Fundraising Initiative</a></h3>
<p>Recognizing the need to enhance our capabilities and streamline the rollout of new services, our immediate focus is on expanding our team. By bolstering our human resources, we aim to ensure efficient development, deployment, and support for our upcoming offerings.</p>
<p>To facilitate this growth, we are currently in the midst of a fundraising campaign. Our projections are optimistic, and we anticipate securing the necessary funds within the next three months. Once achieved, these funds will be instrumental in launching the new services that our team is diligently working on.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this expansion is not just about introducing new services. It also encompasses a strategic upgrade to the ThreeFold grid. This upgrade is particularly significant for our community of farmers. We're transitioning to a revamped tokenomics model, designed to address and rectify challenges faced with the existing model.</p>
<p>In essence, this period marks a transformative phase for ThreeFold Cloud. With a combination of fundraising, team expansion, and system upgrades, we're setting the stage for a more robust, efficient, and rewarding cloud ecosystem for all our stakeholders.</p>
<h3 id="tfgrid-getting-ready-to-move-out-of-the-house"><a class="header" href="#tfgrid-getting-ready-to-move-out-of-the-house">TFGrid getting ready to move out of the house.</a></h3>
<p>TFGrid is an opensource infrastructure platform and TFCloud is a proud promotor and contributor.</p>
<p>TFCloud is committed to help mature TFGrid 4.x and as such allow the TFGrid to become completely independent of TFCloud and TFTech. We expect this might happen mid to end of 2024 and will depend a lot on the colaboration of the community.</p>
<p>This means</p>
<ul>
<li>all works P2P (peer2peer)</li>
<li>an independent network of multiple guardian circles takes over the management and voting is used to decide on all relevant topics</li>
<li>all code is verified by community independent of TFCloud / TFTech.</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically, the ThreeFold Grid Baby is becoming and adult and ready to move out of the house.</p>
<p>Read more about it in our TFGrid section.</p>

<p>The AICloud is designed to be user-centric and adaptive. If a user provides a link containing specific information, the AICloud can ingest this data. This allows for the creation of a personalized chatbot, potentially powered by advanced models like GPT but private, trained specifically on the user's data. The result is a tailored AI chat solution, unique to each user's requirements.</p>
<p>Such capabilities are not just theoretical; they are very much achievable. ThreeFold Cloud is actively working on making them accessible to users, emphasizing ease of use and customization.</p>

<p>ThreeFold Cloud is revolutionizing the way we perceive and interact with cloud services. </p>
<p>Here's how it works:</p>
<p>ThreeFold Cloud introduces a groundbreaking approach to autonomous cloud management, underpinned by three core concepts that ensure seamless operation and user control. The 3 core concepts:</p>
<h3 id="1-objective"><a class="header" href="#1-objective">1. Objective:</a></h3>
<p>Definition: </p>
<ul>
<li>The user defines their desired cloud configuration, also known as the 'wished state' or 'objective'.</li>
<li>Example: a user is specifying the need for a virtual data center with three virtual machines located in specific European countries, connected through a private network, and associated with a particular domain name.</li>
<li>The objective can also be specified by the 3script, which is easy to embed into the wiki system and it's easy to interpret by the personal AI system</li>
</ul>
<p>Visualization: </p>
<ul>
<li>This wished state can be visualized as a sort of wiki system (looks like an searchable ebook with nice graphics), allowing users to easily comprehend their specified objectives.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-reality-state"><a class="header" href="#2-reality-state">2. Reality State:</a></h3>
<p>Function: The 3Bot constantly assesses the current state of the cloud resources, termed the 'reality state'. It evaluates the existing setup, such as the presence of a virtual data center or the uptime of services, and contrasts this with the user's wished state. This may often result in change requests.</p>
<p>Then querying of the reality state is also done through 3script and allows full auditing and logging of requested information and its result. 3script is human readable and easy to understand by AI systems.</p>
<h3 id="3-change-request"><a class="header" href="#3-change-request">3. Change Request:</a></h3>
<p>Change Request Creation: If discrepancies arise between the wished and reality states, the 3Bot calculates these differences and formulates a 'change request'.</p>
<p><strong>Outcome of Comparison:</strong> The change request is the result of comparing the reality state with the wished state. It comprises explicit actions, like creating or deleting a virtual machine or connecting to a network bridge.</p>
<p>The change requests are also logged in 3script, this leads to full auditability.</p>
<p>The change request can even be submitted to a DAO or another consensus driven decision mechanism prior to implementation.</p>
<p>The 3Bot will continuously check objective vs reality state and create change requests, which can be automatically executed or checked by humans.</p>
<h2 id="3bot-executes-above-concept"><a class="header" href="#3bot-executes-above-concept">3Bot executes above concept</a></h2>
<p>The 3Bot, equipped to integrate with both Web2 and Web3, carries out these actions, aligning the reality with the wished state. It continually compares the two states, and if any variance is detected, such as a website being down, the 3Bot diagnoses the issue, formulates corrective actions, and generates new change requests.</p>
<p><strong>Automated Corrections:</strong> This system ensures that any disruptions or deviations are promptly addressed. For instance, if a website goes offline, the 3Bot identifies the cause, be it a malfunctioning virtual machine or another issue, and takes corrective measures.</p>
<p>The synergy of these three concepts – the objective, reality state, and change request – grants users unparalleled control over their cloud operations. This dynamic system can adapt to the customers requirements, making it incredibly versatile. Moreover, its compatibility with Web2 and Web3 services amplifies its potential. Users can integrate diverse functionalities, from Bitcoin transactions to email communications or chat solutions, making ThreeFold Cloud a holistic and innovative solution for modern cloud needs.</p>

<p>The opensource grid is an opensource movement, TFTech an TFCloud are 2 sponsors of this project.</p>
<h1 id="tfcloud"><a class="header" href="#tfcloud">TFCloud</a></h1>
<ul>
<li>The Company who is behind this e-book</li>
<li>TFCloud is called ThreeFold DMCC and is based in Dubai.</li>
<li>TFCloud delivers commercial hosting solutions on top of the grid.</li>
<li>TFCloud products will go life Q1 2024 (beta already in dec 2023)</li>
<li>TFCloud best effort maintains the threefold forum and delivers best effort support for the TFGrid as well.</li>
<li>TFCloud is not a crypto company and has no interest to support speculation or any other financial game around the tokens, TFCloud is all about leveraging a distributed network of compute &amp; storage capacity for its own solutions.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="tftech"><a class="header" href="#tftech">TFTech</a></h1>
<ul>
<li>develops most of the opensource software as used in the TFGrid</li>
<li>contributes all this code </li>
<li>support is best effort</li>
<li>TFTech sells commercial licenses to help companies, governments and enterprises to make most out of the code.</li>
<li>TFTech also does OEM deals with partners for specific usecases.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="promise-to-100-independence-of-tfgrid"><a class="header" href="#promise-to-100-independence-of-tfgrid"><strong>Promise to 100% independence of TFGrid</strong></a></h1>
<ul>
<li>TFCloud and TFGrid are motivated to let the TFGrid infrastructure run independenty from TFTech and TFCloud by mid to end 2024.</li>
<li>Run Independently means
<ul>
<li>less than 20% of the validators or other tech components should be managed by TFTech or TFCloud</li>
<li>less than 20% of the guardians are linked to  TFTech or TFCloud</li>
<li>guardians will have to decide on upgrades of 3nodes linked to their regional internet</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Anyone community in the world can run their own regional Internet without any help of TFCloud/TFTech.</li>
<li>This basically means if TFTech and TFCloud would no longer exist and community has interest to keep on funding the project, then the project can continue by itself. </li>

<p>Each participant (user and/or farmer) of the TFGrid will need  3Bot which can be hosted home or on any of the 3Nodes in the TFGrid. </p>
<p>There are 2 blockchains who support the operation, one dealing with all money and identity matters, the others with the DAO’s and validation functionality of the TFGrid.</p>
<p>The 3Bots communicate on behalf of the users with the TFGrid or any of the blockchains.</p>

</ul>
<p>see <a href="tfcloud/tfgrid/v40/alltrust.html">All Trust Foundational Concept for our TFGrid 4.0</a></p>
<h2 id="simplifications"><a class="header" href="#simplifications">SIMPLIFICATIONS</a></h2>
<p>Our aim is to simplify our TFGrid 4.0 as much as we can and focus on good documentation for the community to be able to contribute or manage the grid without TF Tech’s involvement.</p>
<p>Some examples of what we can simplify, we can remove billing on the chain and replace it with something else, or remove the generic DAO votes, but have them more specific, but so that it's easier for communities to manage their own internet.</p>
<h2 id="billing"><a class="header" href="#billing">BILLING</a></h2>
<p>Billing will not be a native function of tfchain anymore. The idea is that farmers or solution providers can define their own pricing. Maybe there needs to be a minimum price if it's for raw capacity or a maximum. But in general, there will be much more flexibility for the farmer community and the solution providers to define their own pricing, they can build anything on top of the threefold grid. So it's much easier. For them to define the price they want to have for their own efforts. It will be up to the broader community, the users, to define if they want to pay the price as being asked for by the farmer or the solution provider.</p>
<h2 id="tfgrid-guardians"><a class="header" href="#tfgrid-guardians">TFGrid Guardians</a></h2>
<p>There will be multiple roles into threefold grid 4. 0. One very important role will be given to the Grid Guardians. Grid Guardians are people who need to be willing to spend hours per week in the beginning to deploy and maintain their guardian validators and operate the consensus mechanisms. They will be rewarded as such and become an important cornerstone of our decentralization effort.</p>
<p>A guardian will deploy a guardian validator to be part of a Guardian Circles, there need to be at least nine guardians per regional Internet. </p>
<p>A standard validator has all the functions that you would expect from a blockchain and it will be quite easy for a validator to run these services. But some technical expertise will be required. </p>
<p>A guardian validator is required to keep a grid up and running and safe e.g. the Guardian Validator will check the uptime of the 3Nodes, will do random checks to make sure that the 3Nodes are running our certified validated software, it will do certain other checks to do with billing or capacity checks and also store the results of those checks in a database. </p>
<h2 id="2-consensus-mechanisms"><a class="header" href="#2-consensus-mechanisms">2 Consensus Mechanisms</a></h2>
<h3 id="guardian-circles"><a class="header" href="#guardian-circles">Guardian Circles.</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>9-99 nodes, each Guardian runs one Guardian Circles Node.</li>
</ul>
<p>Holding all the logic as needed to manage following functions</p>
<ul>
<li>Checking uptime. </li>
<li>Management of treasury on CHI Chain</li>
<li>Keeping track of capacity used </li>
<li>keeping track of capacity deployed</li>
<li>Providing Proof of Payment (needed for the ZOS nodes to deploy a workload)</li>
<li>Identity Verification</li>
<li>Federation with other Guardian Circles (e.g. around identity and reputation)</li>
</ul>
<p>All data is stored in a replicated database and secured by the Guardian Circle and can be replicated as many times as required by the community.</p>
<p>The Guardian Chain functions can be accessed over Open RPC.</p>

<h1 id="a-paradigm-of-trust"><a class="header" href="#a-paradigm-of-trust">A Paradigm of Trust</a></h1>
<p>What if instead of distrusting others, we embrace a paradigm of trust? The ThreeFold Grid 4.0 system is built on this principle of trust between all participants.</p>
<p>The TFGrid 4.0 comprises different actors, each represented by a 3bot digital assistant. 3bots enable automated interactions between farmers, service providers, and consumers.</p>
<h2 id="farmers-investors-in-shared-infrastructure"><a class="header" href="#farmers-investors-in-shared-infrastructure">Farmers: Investors in Shared Infrastructure</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Farmers invest in hardware capacity like 3Nodes or Mycelium-based services (web gateways, 5G, etc). Their investments fund the grid infrastructure.</li>
<li>Farmers can choose to actively manage their infrastructure using their 3bot. Or they can join a Farming Cooperative to simplify operations.</li>
<li>Either way, farmers earn profits when people purchase and utilize the infrastructure capacity they invested in. Their 3bots handle billing, monitoring, support issues, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="grid-services-facilitating-system-usage"><a class="header" href="#grid-services-facilitating-system-usage">Grid Services: Facilitating System Usage</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Hundreds of different grid services can exist, from storage and compute to telecom and networking. </li>
<li>These services track usage metrics like bandwidth, storage consumption, RPC requests, etc. Usage data is reported transparently to the relevant farming 3bot.</li>
<li>Consumers can interact directly with any service via the Mycelium message bus. Services deploy workloads, fulfill requests, provide monitoring, etc as needed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="flexible-pricing-policies"><a class="header" href="#flexible-pricing-policies">Flexible Pricing Policies</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Farming 3bots define customized pricing policies for their services based on usage. Costs may vary based on compute time, storage quantities, bandwidth, etc.</li>
<li>Pricing flexibility creates an open market. Farmers can price based on costs and desired profit margins. Consumers can shop for services based on performance, reliability, location, and price.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ious-enable-trusted-transactions"><a class="header" href="#ious-enable-trusted-transactions">IOUs Enable Trusted Transactions</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>IOUs (I Owe You) represent agreements between farmers and consumers for grid usage. </li>
<li>Both parties digitally sign each IOU, ensuring consensus on the transaction details.</li>
<li>At regular intervals, farmers submit IOUs to the Mycelium Pay Bridge operated by a Guardian Circle. This aggregates IOUs and requests payment from the consumer 3bots.</li>
<li>Reputations are maintained on the blockchain to identify any bad actors abusing the system. But fundamentally, the system relies on trust between participants.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="guardian-circles-humans-ensuring-oversight"><a class="header" href="#guardian-circles-humans-ensuring-oversight">Guardian Circles: Humans Ensuring Oversight</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>We believe a Guardian Circle has the potential to be as good as blockchain and more because Guardian Circles still provide human oversight over key decisions when needed, the bulk of transactions run automated. </li>
<li>Circles enact decisions when their 9-99 member nodes reach consensus. They manage treasuries, set policies, enable collaboration between regional grids, and more.</li>
<li>Their flexibility allows customization by each grid community based on local needs.</li>
<li>Circles leverage tools like multisig wallets, Mycelium consensus, and VLang DSLs to codify logic while retaining human checks and balances.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="summary"><a class="header" href="#summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p>In summary, ThreeFold Grid 4.0 demonstrates that with the right incentives and oversight, we can build shared digital ecosystems founded on trust and collaboration.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><p><img src="tfcloud/tfgrid/img/decentralization.png" alt="" /></p>
<h1 id="decentralization"><a class="header" href="#decentralization">decentralization</a></h1>
<p>Decentralization, in our view, isn't solely about employing blockchain technology everywhere. Instead, we envision it as the culmination of a global community collaborating transparently, sharing everything they do, and actively seeking feedback. Our goal is to ensure that the platform we deploy operates in the most distributed and decentralized manner possible.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><p><img src="tfcloud/tfgrid/img/tokenomics.png" alt="" /></p>
<h2 id="tfgrid-tokenomics-upgrade"><a class="header" href="#tfgrid-tokenomics-upgrade">TFGrid Tokenomics Upgrade</a></h2>
<p>The tokenomics of any digital ecosystem plays a pivotal role in determining its sustainability, growth, and value proposition. In the case of ThreeFold, there are evident challenges with the current tokenomics model that necessitate an upgrade.</p>
<p>The current tokenomics model of ThreeFold doesn't fully reflect the platform's worth and potential. An upgrade is essential to rectify existing challenges, ensuring that the tokenomics aligns with the platform's growth trajectory and offers a fair representation of its value.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of Commercial Utilization: 
<ul>
<li>The present model doesn't sufficiently incentivize commercial utilization. This means that the tokens, instead of being used to facilitate transactions or access services within the ecosystem, are often liquidated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Selling Pressure from Farmers: 
<ul>
<li>The current dynamics have led to a scenario where ThreeFold farmers frequently sell their tokens. This consistent selling exerts downward pressure on the token's price, preventing it from realizing its true potential value.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Undervalued Market Cap: 
<ul>
<li>The cumulative effect of these factors has resulted in a market capitalization for the liquid tokens that is significantly undervalued. With a market cap hovering around 5 million dollars, it starkly contrasts with the intrinsic value and potential of the ThreeFold ecosystem.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Future Optimism: Despite the current challenges, there's a strong belief in the imminent positive shift in the token's value. As ThreeFold gears up to launch more commercial workloads and with the anticipated funding for TF Cloud, there's an expectation of increased commercial utilization. This, in turn, can drive demand for the token, potentially boosting its price and aligning the market cap more closely with ThreeFold's true value.</p>
<p>We are working on some fundamental changes which will achieve the following</p>
<ul>
<li>TFT farming will slow down and there will probably never be more than 1 billion TFT ever</li>
<li>Farmers will receive more reward based on Utilization</li>
<li>Staking is a required for becoming a future Farmer or Farming Cooperative</li>
<li>P2P Billing and Payments will lead to using TFT for much more services, which will have positive impact as well.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Mycelium runs on top of the TFGrid which is opensource Internet Infrastructure platform.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mycelium is a Internet Platform designed to become smarter and more creative together and expand collective consciousness. Built on proven technologies, Mycelium allows peer-to-peer networks to flourish without centralized intermediaries.</p>
<p>Mycelium has no central point of control. The voluntary nodes forming the Mycelium network are operated by individuals and communities who share resources and capabilities to manifest a common vision. This structure aligns with principles of decentralization and autonomy.</p>
<p>Rich capabilities empower users to connect, communicate, transact and collaborate while retaining ownership of their own data and digital identities. Features like self-sovereign identity and encrypted communications enhance privacy and user agency.</p>
<p>Incentive structures reward conscious contributions that regenerate communities and the planet. The Mycelium ecosystem cultivates an ethos of compassion, sustainability and abundance.</p>
<p>With Mycelium, we can rebuild critical systems - from currency to culture - in a more decentralized, conscious manner. Mycelium provides the infrastructure for a digitally-connected society aligned with our highest values. </p>
<p><strong>A worldwide web of compassion is within reach if we take up the challenge.</strong></p>

<h1 id="autonomous-safe-cloud-and-ai-platform"><a class="header" href="#autonomous-safe-cloud-and-ai-platform">Autonomous Safe Cloud and AI Platform</a></h1>
<p>Imagine a world where everyone is empowered to deploy any Blockchain, Cloud or AI workloads with self-healing and Autonomous capabilities. This system would dynamically allocate or deallocate CPU’s and GPUs based on computational needs. The Autonomous System would recover from unforeseen scenarios, restoring operational efficiency and adhering to redundancy requirements to ensure continuous and reliable performance.</p>
<p>This entire process runs without compromising security. The system isn't managed by the AI itself, but by separate circuits tied to a collective of human stakeholders (we call this a Human Chain). These stakeholders retain control over the operation at all times. It could be that a consensus among these stakeholders is necessary before executing specific change requests, serving as a measure for enhanced security. This is ensured through the deployment of two independent, unconnected circuits. The first is the AI circuit, essentially your AI application, which can harness thousands of GPUs and process vast amounts of information. Concurrently, there's the Control Circuit, which is governed by Human Chains, keeping human oversight integral to the system's operation. </p>
<p>The AI Circuit doesn't have access to the Control Circuit. Any modification in the Control Circuit requires consensus before implementation, and our foolproof system ensures that all changes are deployed in strict accordance with the intended state (we call this a Tamper Proof deployment). This process guarantees a 100% match between the actual deployment and the originally planned modifications.</p>
<p>The integrity of our Control Circuit is safeguarded from potential threats such as other AI systems, quantum computers, or cyber attackers. This security is due to our adoption of consensus-based principles analogous to those utilized in modern blockchain technologies.</p>
<p>We believe that no other company approaches this level of capability. In our opinion, the creation of a true autonomous AI system is not possible without an operating system such as our Zero-OS.</p>
<p>Above described system is not a dream but is close to being reality in our version 4.0 of our software stack.</p>
<h1 id="threefold-mimics-nature"><a class="header" href="#threefold-mimics-nature">ThreeFold Mimics Nature</a></h1>
<p><img src="tfcloud/techvision/img/techvision_1.png" alt="image alt text" /></p>
<p>Today's IT systems are too complicated and layered, causing a whole heap of problems like using too much electricity, making life hard for developers, not using computer resources in the best way, and creating security, privacy, scalability, and performance issues. </p>
<p>But there's good news: ThreeFold is hard at work building an autonomous generic usable IT platform. This platform is designed to offer everything needed to make the back-end of the Internet, AI, and Blockchain work better.</p>
<p>At ThreeFold we like to look at nature and learn from it, this is also called Biomimicry. Biomimicry is a design discipline that seeks to solve human problems by emulating nature's time-tested patterns and strategies. The core idea is that nature, with 3.8 billion years of evolution and adaptation, has already solved many of the problems we are grappling with. Animals, plants, and microbes are the consummate engineers and designers.</p>
<p>3Bots represent humans and work together in consensus to control any IT workload. They utilize the capacity of 3Nodes in such a way to maximize reliability, uptime, security, and privacy. The 3Bots facilitate users' access to the extensive knowledge encapsulated within the AI Cloud. This AI Cloud can be trained with contributions from thousands of individuals. Additionally, developers are relieved of the overwhelming complexity prevalent in today's systems.</p>
<p>The current ThreeFold opensource platform is generation 3 and expanding every day, see <a href="tfcloud/techvision/img/https://dashboard.grid.tf/explorer/statistics">https://dashboard.grid.tf/explorer/statistics</a> . </p>
<p>ThreeFold is now ready to deliver customized private versions of this platform for any use case which requires more efficiency, manageability, scalability and security.</p>

<p><img src="tfcloud/techvision/img/techvision_2.png" alt="image alt text" /></p>
<p>Millions of 3Nodes can empower the capacity layer, billions of 3Bots can be the Autonomous Agents managing any of the workloads in the network. Each 3Bot is owned by one person. The 3Bots can operate Autonomous Circles which are driven by Human Chains.</p>
<p>The connection between the 3Bot and the owner is secure and private. All 3Bots are identified through a blockchain and reputation is an important concept to make sure our network is as safe as possible.</p>
<p>AI Clouds are networks of AI capacity owned by Autonomous Circles. We believe in a world where there will not be one huge AI but many AI’s owned by different groups of people.</p>
<p>The 3Bots can operate and communicate with any Web3 based technology. This provides for ultimate flexibility and allows Autonomous Circles or 3Bots to deal with smart contracts and digital currencies.</p>

<p>Zero-OS is our uniquely designed stateless Operating System which is efficient and optimized for autonomous operation. The Zero-OS uses blockchain technology to allow people by means of their 3Bots deploy IT workloads with more security and using less electricity. Zero-OS cannot be used by people directly, it's an operating system close to the hardware and designed to deliver the features as described below.</p>
<p>A 3Node is a computer running the Zero-OS. 3Nodes are interconnected to together create an AI Cloud. An overlay secure private network is used to make sure IT workloads can communicate fast and privately.</p>

<h2 id="ai-cloud"><a class="header" href="#ai-cloud">AI CLOUD</a></h2>
<p>Capable of scaling up to millions of GPUs and thousands of independent but optionally interconnected clouds, each AI Cloud is equipped with its own blockchain used for tracking of farming (mining) and utilization/billing of the Cloud. The AI Clouds can be interconnected or deployed in a complete private context. The AI clouds are managed by consensus driven 3Bots.</p>
<h2 id="3bot"><a class="header" href="#3bot">3BOT</a></h2>
<p>3Bots are owned by people. Each 3Bot represents one person, they can together manage complicated IT workloads. People can define Autonomous Circles which represent topics of interest e.g. deployment of an AI system. Each project can be co-owned by more than one 3Bot (person).</p>
<p>A 3Bot has the knowledge required to deploy, manage and operate IT workloads like AI, Blockchain or others. A 3Bot knows how to self heal and rebalance resources as required to optimize performance, energy usage and uptime. </p>
<h2 id="autonomous--consensus-driven"><a class="header" href="#autonomous--consensus-driven">AUTONOMOUS &amp; CONSENSUS DRIVEN</a></h2>
<h3 id="autonomous-circle"><a class="header" href="#autonomous-circle">Autonomous Circle</a></h3>
<p>An Autonomous Circle is like a project which holds all required information, resources and knowledge required to operationally manage an IT environment. An example could be an AI based Application or a Private Blockchain.</p>
<p>An Autonomous Circle is owned by one or more 3Bots. A consensus criteria can be defined which means that important changes in the project need consensus of the stakeholders. The co-owners of an Autonomous Circle can create an optional treasury of financial assets (money). The co-owners together own the treasury, the treasury can be used to reward the members of the circles for contribution or pay for the resources as used in the AI Cloud.</p>
<p>Autonomous Circles are kept healthy thanks to the knowledge as owned by the 3Bots. The 3Bots will monitor and act if issues arise, this produces consensus driven management for cloud applications.</p>

<p>The Human Chain concept is important to deliver a &quot;safe&quot; Autonomous AI System. A Human Chain functions similarly to a blockchain but rather than relying on a smart contract to execute a consensus mechanism, it ensures human stakeholders maintain complete visibility into the operation and modification requests. Humans have total awareness of all ongoing activities and, as a collective, can effect changes in the deployment upon reaching a consensus.</p>
<p>A Human Chain is the combination of a certain number of 3Bots co-owning an Autonomous Circle. The Co-owners of such a project own the Human Chain and validate all transactions as executed on behalf of the Autonomous Circle. If consensus cannot be reached, the required transactions will not be accepted by the rest of the ecosystem. A Human Chain can also secure a treasury of money.</p>
<p>While we don't foresee AI becoming conscious and posing a global threat in the near future, we do acknowledge that AI systems are potent tools. These tools can be misused by hackers, or errors can occur, leading to serious consequences, this is where a Human Chain can help.</p>
<h1 id="some-of-the-benefits"><a class="header" href="#some-of-the-benefits">SOME OF THE BENEFITS</a></h1>
<h2 id="deterministic-deployments"><a class="header" href="#deterministic-deployments">Deterministic Deployments</a></h2>
<p>The system is able to build the required software (e.g. AI Application) in a secure and deterministic way. The build systems are run autonomously but still controlled by a Human Chain.</p>
<p>Once consensus achieved, builds verified they will be deployed using our Tamper Proof system which makes sure that the build will always correspond to the reality. No hacker or alternative system will be able to influence how applications get deployed on the AI Grid.</p>
<h2 id="private-ai"><a class="header" href="#private-ai">Private AI</a></h2>
<p>The concept of Private AI facilitates safer and more confidential data processing by AI systems. It enables the processing of vast amounts of data in such a manner that human access is either eliminated or, if necessary, granted in a highly controlled way through blockchain mechanisms.</p>
<p>Take the instance of security camera footage processing. The challenge lies in allowing AI to handle all the processing while ensuring that the same information remains inaccessible to hackers or compromised security personnel.</p>
<h2 id="edge-ai"><a class="header" href="#edge-ai">Edge AI</a></h2>
<p>Occasionally, it's more practical to transport the AI application to the data's location instead of vice versa. For instance, consider security cameras and AI image processing. Picture the ability to deploy a new AI application across thousands of cameras simultaneously in just a minute, delivering insights more quickly and securely. New approaches are required to realize this potential.</p>
<h2 id="rapid-start"><a class="header" href="#rapid-start">Rapid Start</a></h2>
<p>Deploy your AI workload much faster without having to copy as much data. Certain AI workloads can be sizable (many Gigabytes), it can take a long time for these workloads to be deployed especially if AI will be used in an Edge AI Context. Systems which otherwise would take 30 min to be deployed we can do in less than 1 minute.</p>
<h2 id="tamper-proof"><a class="header" href="#tamper-proof">Tamper Proof</a></h2>
<p>Deploy your AI workloads in such a way that no-one can modify the intended result. Even if only as much as 1 bit would be changed between time of build and deployment Zero-OS will refuse to start the application.</p>
<h2 id="quantum-safe-storage"><a class="header" href="#quantum-safe-storage">Quantum Safe Storage</a></h2>
<p>Our QSS allows data to be stored in such a way that data can never be lost nor corrupted. Not even a quantum computer can get access to the information.</p>
<h1 id="the-role-of-quantum-safe-storage-for-ai"><a class="header" href="#the-role-of-quantum-safe-storage-for-ai">THE ROLE OF QUANTUM SAFE STORAGE FOR AI</a></h1>
<p><img src="tfcloud/techvision/img/techvision_5.png" alt="image alt text" /></p>
<p>Imagine a storage system with the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>up to 10x more efficient (power and usage of hardware) for certain workloads</li>
<li>ultra reliable, data can not be lost</li>
<li>ultra safe &amp; private</li>
<li>ultra scalable</li>
<li>sovereign, data is close to you in the country of your choice</li>
<li>true Peer To Peer, by everyone for everyone.</li>
<li>not even a quantum computer can hack the storage</li>
</ul>
<p>It is not a dream, it does already exist.</p>
<p>Our storage architecture follows a true distributed design. Participating nodes (can be on ultra safe locations) only store small incomplete parts of data (files, photos, movies, databases…) by only offering a slice of their current (local) storage devices. Managing the storage and retrieval of all these ‘distributed fragments’ is done by a software that creates ‘development and/or end-user interfaces’ for this storage algorithm. We call this ‘dispersed storage‘.</p>
<p>The user has complete control over where the data is stored and which level of redundancy which is required.</p>
<p>A storage system like this is very useful for an AI system, large datasets can be ingested or large language models loaded more quickly. We can even thin provision these language models to be even more efficient.</p>

<p><strong>THE OURWORLD VISION</strong></p>
<p>Our Modern Crisis:</p>
<ul>
<li>Centralized AI and data platforms lack transparency and accountability. 
This raises concerns about manipulating users or limiting their agency.</li>
<li>Erosion of privacy and bodily autonomy through invasive surveillance and social credit systems. This endangers freedom of choice and expression.</li>
<li>Environmental degradation that threatens sustainability of natural systems humanity depends on.</li>
<li>Proliferation of misinformation that polarizes society. This impedes reasoned discourse and collective problem-solving.</li>
</ul>
<p>These interconnected crises endanger the future – yet also present an opportunity for transformation. Business as usual will not suffice. Fundamental upgrades are needed across society.</p>
<p>Guiding Principles for Change (Planet and People First)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consciousness</strong> - Cultivate self-awareness, ethics and wisdom within each person.</li>
<li><strong>Compassion</strong> - Practice understanding, service and sharing. Choose collaboration over division. </li>
<li><strong>Sustainability</strong> - Incentivize regeneration. Safeguard ecosystems for future generations. </li>
<li><strong>Autonomy</strong> - Honor rights to self-determination and sovereignty. Prevent authoritarian overreach.</li>
<li><strong>Meritocracy</strong> - Structure governance to draw on diverse expertise while limiting corrupt influence.</li>
<li><strong>Abundance</strong> - Innovate systems that create shared prosperity through new economic models. </li>
</ul>
<p>Tools:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Decentralization</strong> Develop decentralized peer-to-peer networks for data, finance, communications, etc. This distributes power more equitably without centralized intermediaries.</li>
<li><strong>Promote Education</strong> that fosters critical thinking, self-awareness, and ethical values. This empowers individuals to make wise choices despite manipulative messaging.</li>
<li><strong>Connect people</strong> across divides to find common ground. This fosters societal cohesion and collective wisdom to address shared challenges.</li>
<li><strong>Design economic models</strong> that incentivize regeneration, compassion and creativity over self-interest. This creates abundance and reduces inequality.</li>
<li>Champion <strong>open collaboration</strong> on solutions that benefit all of humanity and the planet. This unites us in shared purpose (opensource)</li>
<li><strong>Support</strong> individual and community rights to self-determination and bodily <strong>sovereignty</strong>. This prevents authoritarian overreach and protects freedoms.</li>
</ul>
<p>Everyone has a role to play in this transformation. We must lift up humanity by elevating consciousness, enacting wise governance, developing ethical technologies, and coming together in good faith. The answers exist if we dare to dream widely and act boldly.</p>
