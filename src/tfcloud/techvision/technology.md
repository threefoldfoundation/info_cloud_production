## Introduction

TFCloud is an autonomous and safe cloud platform thanks to its design mimicking nature leading to its unlimited scalability and flexibility. 

We present here the ThreeFold Vision in a nutshell.

## Autonomous Safe Cloud and AI Platform 

Imagine a world where everyone is empowered to deploy any Blockchain, Cloud or AI workloads with self-healing and Autonomous capabilities. This system would dynamically allocate or deallocate CPU’s and GPUs based on computational needs. The Autonomous System would recover from unforeseen scenarios, restoring operational efficiency and adhering to redundancy requirements to ensure continuous and reliable performance.

This entire process runs without compromising security. The system isn't managed by the AI itself, but by separate circuits tied to a collective of human stakeholders (we call this a Human Chain). These stakeholders retain control over the operation at all times. It could be that a consensus among these stakeholders is necessary before executing specific change requests, serving as a measure for enhanced security. This is ensured through the deployment of two independent, unconnected circuits. The first is the AI circuit, essentially your AI application, which can harness thousands of GPUs and process vast amounts of information. Concurrently, there's the Control Circuit, which is governed by Human Chains, keeping human oversight integral to the system's operation. 

The AI Circuit doesn't have access to the Control Circuit. Any modification in the Control Circuit requires consensus before implementation, and our foolproof system ensures that all changes are deployed in strict accordance with the intended state (we call this a Tamper Proof deployment). This process guarantees a 100% match between the actual deployment and the originally planned modifications.

The integrity of our Control Circuit is safeguarded from potential threats such as other AI systems, quantum computers, or cyber attackers. This security is due to our adoption of consensus-based principles analogous to those utilized in modern blockchain technologies.

We believe that no other company approaches this level of capability. In our opinion, the creation of a true autonomous AI system is not possible without an operating system such as our Zero-OS.

Above described system is not a dream but is close to being reality in our version 4.0 of our software stack.

## ThreeFold Mimics Nature

Today's IT systems are too complicated and layered, causing a whole heap of problems like using too much electricity, making life hard for developers, not using computer resources in the best way, and creating security, privacy, scalability, and performance issues. 

But there's good news: ThreeFold is hard at work building an autonomous generic usable IT platform. This platform is designed to offer everything needed to make the back-end of the Internet, AI, and Blockchain work better.

At ThreeFold we like to look at nature and learn from it, this is also called Biomimicry. Biomimicry is a design discipline that seeks to solve human problems by emulating nature's time-tested patterns and strategies. The core idea is that nature, with 3.8 billion years of evolution and adaptation, has already solved many of the problems we are grappling with. Animals, plants, and microbes are the consummate engineers and designers.

3Bots represent humans and work together in consensus to control any IT workload. They utilize the capacity of 3Nodes in such a way to maximize reliability, uptime, security, and privacy. The 3Bots facilitate users' access to the extensive knowledge encapsulated within the AI Cloud. This AI Cloud can be trained with contributions from thousands of individuals. Additionally, developers are relieved of the overwhelming complexity prevalent in today's systems.

The current ThreeFold opensource platform is generation 3 and expanding every day, see [https://dashboard.grid.tf/explorer/statistics](img/https://dashboard.grid.tf/explorer/statistics) . 

ThreeFold is now ready to deliver customized private versions of this platform for any use case which requires more efficiency, manageability, scalability and security.

## Unlimited Scalable & Flexible

Millions of 3Nodes can empower the capacity layer, billions of 3Bots can be the Autonomous Agents managing any of the workloads in the network. Each 3Bot is owned by one person. The 3Bots can operate Autonomous Circles which are driven by Human Chains.

The connection between the 3Bot and the owner is secure and private. All 3Bots are identified through a blockchain and reputation is an important concept to make sure our network is as safe as possible.

AI Clouds are networks of AI capacity owned by Autonomous Circles. We believe in a world where there will not be one huge AI but many AI’s owned by different groups of people.

The 3Bots can operate and communicate with any Web3 based technology. This provides for ultimate flexibility and allows Autonomous Circles or 3Bots to deal with smart contracts and digital currencies.
