## Introduction

The ThreeFold Cloud comes with many benefits for users. We present here the most salliant ones.

## Deterministic Deployments

The system is able to build the required software (e.g. AI Application) in a secure and deterministic way. The build systems are run autonomously but still controlled by a Human Chain.

Once consensus achieved, builds verified they will be deployed using our Tamper Proof system which makes sure that the build will always correspond to the reality. No hacker or alternative system will be able to influence how applications get deployed on the AI Grid.

## Private AI

The concept of Private AI facilitates safer and more confidential data processing by AI systems. It enables the processing of vast amounts of data in such a manner that human access is either eliminated or, if necessary, granted in a highly controlled way through blockchain mechanisms.

Take the instance of security camera footage processing. The challenge lies in allowing AI to handle all the processing while ensuring that the same information remains inaccessible to hackers or compromised security personnel.

## Edge AI

Occasionally, it's more practical to transport the AI application to the data's location instead of vice versa. For instance, consider security cameras and AI image processing. Picture the ability to deploy a new AI application across thousands of cameras simultaneously in just a minute, delivering insights more quickly and securely. New approaches are required to realize this potential.

## Rapid Start

Deploy your AI workload much faster without having to copy as much data. Certain AI workloads can be sizable (many Gigabytes), it can take a long time for these workloads to be deployed especially if AI will be used in an Edge AI Context. Systems which otherwise would take 30 min to be deployed we can do in less than 1 minute.

## Tamper Proof

Deploy your AI workloads in such a way that no-one can modify the intended result. Even if only as much as 1 bit would be changed between time of build and deployment Zero-OS will refuse to start the application.

## Quantum Safe Storage 

Our QSS allows data to be stored in such a way that data can never be lost nor corrupted. Not even a quantum computer can get access to the information.
