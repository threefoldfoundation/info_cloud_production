## The Cloud Lifecycle

ThreeFold Cloud is revolutionizing the way we perceive and interact with cloud services. 

Here's how it works:

ThreeFold Cloud introduces a groundbreaking approach to autonomous cloud management, underpinned by three core concepts that ensure seamless operation and user control. The 3 core concepts:

### 1. Objective:

Definition: 

* The user defines their desired cloud configuration, also known as the 'wished state' or 'objective'.
* Example: a user is specifying the need for a virtual data center with three virtual machines located in specific European countries, connected through a private network, and associated with a particular domain name.
* The objective can also be specified by the 3script, which is easy to embed into the wiki system and it's easy to interpret by the personal AI system

Visualization: 

* This wished state can be visualized as a sort of wiki system (looks like an searchable ebook with nice graphics), allowing users to easily comprehend their specified objectives.


### 2. Reality State:

Function: The 3Bot constantly assesses the current state of the cloud resources, termed the 'reality state'. It evaluates the existing setup, such as the presence of a virtual data center or the uptime of services, and contrasts this with the user's wished state. This may often result in change requests.

Then querying of the reality state is also done through 3script and allows full auditing and logging of requested information and its result. 3script is human readable and easy to understand by AI systems.

### 3. Change Request:

Change Request Creation: If discrepancies arise between the wished and reality states, the 3Bot calculates these differences and formulates a 'change request'.

**Outcome of Comparison:** The change request is the result of comparing the reality state with the wished state. It comprises explicit actions, like creating or deleting a virtual machine or connecting to a network bridge.

The change requests are also logged in 3script, this leads to full auditability.

The change request can even be submitted to a DAO or another consensus driven decision mechanism prior to implementation.

The 3Bot will continuously check objective vs reality state and create change requests, which can be automatically executed or checked by humans.

## 3Bot executes above concept

The 3Bot, equipped to integrate with both Web2 and Web3, carries out these actions, aligning the reality with the wished state. It continually compares the two states, and if any variance is detected, such as a website being down, the 3Bot diagnoses the issue, formulates corrective actions, and generates new change requests.

**Automated Corrections:** This system ensures that any disruptions or deviations are promptly addressed. For instance, if a website goes offline, the 3Bot identifies the cause, be it a malfunctioning virtual machine or another issue, and takes corrective measures.

The synergy of these three concepts – the objective, reality state, and change request – grants users unparalleled control over their cloud operations. This dynamic system can adapt to the customers requirements, making it incredibly versatile. Moreover, its compatibility with Web2 and Web3 services amplifies its potential. Users can integrate diverse functionalities, from Bitcoin transactions to email communications or chat solutions, making ThreeFold Cloud a holistic and innovative solution for modern cloud needs.
