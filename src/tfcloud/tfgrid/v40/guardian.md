### INCA Reward

INCA stands for INternet CApacity, is a sort of IOU between TFCloud and the owner of the INCA Token.

The Guardian will receive the INCA Token and TFCloud is obliged to fulfil the obligations as set in the INCA token metadata (the payment).

For the curious you can see the architecture of how an INCA 3script representation looks like [here](inca_3script_example.md)
