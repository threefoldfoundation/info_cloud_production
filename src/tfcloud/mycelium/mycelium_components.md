## Mycelium Network Agent

A smart agent which runs on mobile phones, desktop and servers. All agents together create the Mycelium Network which might be the most reliable and secure internet network ever created.

The Network agent also provides other network services like name services, p2p database, reputation mgmt, micro payments, reliable message bus,  … 

All network traffic is end2end encrypted and can survive internet network outages. Hackers cannot intercept traffic or modify any information. The shortest path is always chosen between 2 participants in a communication flow (not based on algorithmic properties but based on latency and quality of network).

## Mycelium Cloud

Another name for our newest generation of the ThreeFold Cloud, the ability to host any linux, blockchain or AI workload on a global scale as long as we have enough motivated farmers to provide capacity. Farmers get rewarded for providing network, compute and storage capacity.

## Mycelium AI

A network of GPU’s which can be used by developers in the most flexible way using micropayments, avoiding large capex requirements. Our Aim is to enable the largest AI Network in the world for emerging countries. Micropayments are used to reward the providers of the GPU’s as well as Vector DB’s.

## Mycelium Search

AI based search, accessible by all participants and hosted by all participants in such a way we can index our new Internet. Is using opensource AI Models and large distributed vector databases. 

## Mycelium Circles

Collaboration tool written in Vlang, output is a nicely formatted ebook which dynamically gets regenerated depending on business model, crm data, cash flow, milestones, necessary requirements, tasks, … 

This is a revolutionary tool to be the base for our future collaboration.

## Fungi Stor

Different storage and database tools are required for any app to come alive, 

* Fungi VECTOR: needed for AI Applications
* Fungi STOR (Storage)
* Fungi STREAM (video, audio)
* Fungi FS (FileSystem)  (Q2 2024)
* Fungi SQL (H2 2024)

All of these storage applications work in full decentralized peer2peer way on top of the Mycelium Cloud and Network.

## Fungi Pay

None of the above can be done without a micropayment solution. 

Fungi Pay allows consumers of any network, compute, storage or any other cloud service to pay super small fees without latency and complications. Fungi Pay is based on IOU’s

These IOU’s are called Spores or in short SPRS , 1 SPR is a unit of exchange of value. You can exchange anything for anything else everywhere.

## Fungi Bridge

IOU’s need to be rolled up and be transformed to money transactions on blockchain or classic banking systems. Fungi Bridge takes care of this function and works from out of a sovereign digital freezone.

## MyTwin (Mycelium or My Twin)

Each Person owns a MyTwin, which is your avatar acting on your behalf on the Mycelium Network. Your MyTwin (MT) is the only digital creator who has the capability to reconstruct and manage your private data.

## VLang

Our own fast compiled safe development language.

## 3Node

ThreeFold Nodes also called 3Nodes are perfect hosts for the Mycelium Ecosystem, each of the above components can be hosted on 3Nodes.

In v4 of ThreeFold, farmers receive SPRS in exchange to TFT by means of a Fungi Bridge.

## OurPhone

Eventually we need our own phone, fully integrated and ready to go to unlock this ecosystem.
