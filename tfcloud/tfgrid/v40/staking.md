Each TFGrid 4.0 Internet operates on a local currency called CHI and the only way to get CHI is by sending TFT to that chain. The users of the TFGrid will have to stake a certain amount of CHI before they can use our more advanced TFGrid 4.x 

The farmers for TFGrid 4, will also have to stake CHI and there will be a small lock up period in time or until there is a certain utilization on the nodes.  That means that deploying and using independent TFGrids will drive a lot of TFT utilization and as such show support from our community for the ThreeFold truly Decentralized Internet.
