# Mycelium: A Platform for Conscious Decentralization

Mycelium has as purpose to restore the Internet to its original glory, a true Peer2Peer platform
capable to expand our collective consciousness. Mycelium allows human networks to flourish without centralized intermediaries.

Mycelium uses the ThreeFold Grid as its base capacity cloud layer (storage, compute, network) which is opensource Internet Infrastructure platform.

Mycelium has no central point of control. Community provided nodes forming the Mycelium network are operated by individuals and communities who share resources and capabilities to manifest a common vision. 

Rich capabilities empower users to connect, communicate, transact and collaborate while retaining ownership of their own data and digital identities. Features like self-sovereign identity and encrypted communications enhance privacy and user agency.

Incentive structures reward conscious contributions that regenerate communities and the planet. The Mycelium ecosystem cultivates an ethos of compassion, sustainability and abundance.

With Mycelium, we can rebuild critical systems - from currency to culture - in a more decentralized, conscious manner. Mycelium provides a programmeable, affordable, secure and ultra scalable layer for a digitally-connected society aligned with our highest values. 

**A worldwide web of compassion is within reach if we take up the challenge.**
