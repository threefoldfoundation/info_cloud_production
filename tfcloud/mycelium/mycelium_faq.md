# FAQ

## Is this a blockchain or crypto project

NO, we are compatible with many blockchains but we donâ€™t rely on them. We believe peer2peer and consensus driven decision systems with bridges to other blockchains are more powerful and way more scalable, secure and efficient.

## Is this realistic?

We have been working on this for many many years over different of our own startups. We believe we have the pieces developed and ready to be integrated to a productized solution which can be used by many.

ThreeFold.IO can be seen as our 3e generation implementation of a peer2peer cloud.

We are very proud of our team and grateful for the constant out of box thinking.

## When will we have it?

Within 6 months is realistic, we are finalizing our next funding round and then we can go fast.

## How does Mycelium compare to?

* Urbit: a truly amazing project, many similar ideals and goals, we hope to be easier for people to start with and also be production quality faster.

* Holochain: a very nice project, focussed on personal data pods as well, with intelligent decentralized peer2peer compute. Longer history than us. Good community. 

Maybe rather than compete we can even work together?

Some of the problems we have tackled we have literally been trying to solve now for more than 30 years, we believe we are getting close, let's together try to break it, so we can fix it.
