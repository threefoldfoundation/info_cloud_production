# ROADMAP

Still very rough… 

## V1.0 = minimal viable product for the early adopter

End Q1 2023 should be possible if we can focus on creation and get in expansion mode. AI will still be somewhat basic. In parallel we need to grow our community in farmers to be ready for expansion.

## V1.1 = more user friendly interaction

* Super power full conversational UI for our digital life

* Nice web UI (or native for mobile)

* Much more powerful AI features

* First version of ourphone

## V1.2 = advanced features

* Metaverse (Augmented reality, …) using our own p2p gaming engine based on vlang.
